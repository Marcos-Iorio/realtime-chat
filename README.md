You can use the app here https://realtime-chat-marcos-iorio.vercel.app/.

## Usage

To use the app put in the console ```git clone https://github.com/Marcos-Iorio/realtime-chat.git```

## Client
 ```
 cd client
 npm install
 cd ./chat/
 npm start
 ```
 Go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser.

## Server
 ```
 cd server
 npm install
 ndoe index.js
 ```
 Then go to http://localhost:5000 to view the server(is not required to open it)

## About
Right now the app is running in Heroku and Vercel, if you want to run it locally, you have to change the SERVER variable in the ChatRoom.jsx to http://localhost:5000. The main approach of this project is to learn Socket.io and practising React, in this case i practice a lot of useRef, and i improve my css skills.
